# - disable_weather_api_requests = false (allows HTTP calls that wiremock intercepts)
# - Tests set OPEN_METEO_BASE_URL env var to point to mock server

# For BOM tests (fixture-based, not yet migrated):
# - Would need disable_weather_api_requests = true to use cached fixtures
# - For now, set to false globally since Open-Meteo tests are the default

# Note: To run BOM tests, override with: APP_DEBUGGING__DISABLE_WEATHER_API_REQUESTS=true APP_API__PROVIDER=bom
